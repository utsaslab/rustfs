     # We link library here instead of doing following in build.rs:
     #     println!("cargo:rustc-link-search=/home/zeyuanhu/spdk/build/lib/");
     #     println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=dylib=spdk");
     # because the program has to run in sudo and somehow cargo cannot find
     # the dynamic library path under sudo. Probably will find a better way to solve the issue.
     # Possible fixes:
     # - We ship a setup script to perform variable substitution here (e.g. link-arg=$SPDK_LIB_DIR/libspdk.so)
